# ResNet-and-ViT-with-CuPy
This is a personal project, where I try to recreate the famous ResNet and ViT using the CuPy library. I was going to use numpy, but since cupy is probably going to be faster, that's what I'm going to use.

This project is also a source code for an IBDP Extended Essay titled "Discuss the Improvement between Visual Geometry Group Network and Residual Neural Network due to Structural Change", which I state here that all the code is authorized, and does not involve any acedemical dishonest issue.
